h1. japid42 - Japid for Play 2

h2. About

This is a port of Japid to the Play2 framework. 

The idea is to have a native Java based template engine for Java programmers using Play2. 

Some of the benefits of using Japid in Play2:

1. Almost no latency in reloading changed views. Japid manages its own view compilation and class loading. Changes in the Japid views are isolated from the Play reloading mechanism. 

2. Full featured. It at least matches the feature set of the built-in Scala based template engine. 

3. Excellent runtime performance. 

4. Java-based, thus very friendly to Java programmers.

5. The core Japid has been used in production for a long time and is very robust.  


h2. Features

Most of the Japid 1 features have been ported:

- layout
- tags
- action invocations from views
- implicit objects available in views: request, response, session, flash
- other language constructs

What are missing?

- cache with action invocation, i.e., the @`a@ command does not support cache yet.
- validation: I'm still investigating how the whole validation thing works in Play2. 
- Flash success/error: the new flash in Play2 is a generic HashMap. 
- session.authentityToken not supported
- implicit objects: params, args
- pretty error page for japid errors, compile time or runtime. 

What are different?

- reverse routing: @{} not supported and deprecated by Play2's direct route class call for each route rule. 

h2. Build the module from source

1. Git clone the Japid42 project to your local computer. 
2. Build it and publish it to your local repository: "play publish-local", where the play is the Play2 binary. I'm using sbt 0.11.2 locally. 


h2. Usage


Please check out the JapidSample project in the samples directory for an example. 

Basically you'll need to do three things:

0. Get the dependencies

- declare it in the project/Build.scala:
<pre>
//...
    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "japid42" % "japid42_2.9.1" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
    )
//...
</pre>

Note: adjust the version number accordingly. 

- copy the javaparser-1.0.8.jar and org.eclipse.jdt.core-3.8.0.v_C18.jar from the lib directory to the lib directory in your project. 

1. Initialize Japid in Global.java in the app directory:

<pre>
//...
public class Global extends GlobalSettings {
    @Override
    public void onStart(Application app) {
        JapidRenderer.setParentClassLoader(app.classloader());
        JapidRenderer.init(Play.isDev()? OpMode.dev:  OpMode.prod, "japidroot", 2);
        JapidRenderer.addImportStatic(StringUtils.class);
        JapidRenderer.gen();
    }
    //...
}
</pre>  

Note:

a. The "japidroot" in the second line in the method can be anything you like. It's a folder in the application root and it contains all the japid artifacts. Essentially it needs to be outside of the app directory. 
  
b. The addImportStatic line is up to you if you need to include some implicit imports in all the japid views. 
 
2. Extend JapidController to create your own controllers and use the renderJapid(...) etc to render the views. These views are in the japid root directory in a similar directory structure as the the controller hierarchy. 

For detailed Japid grammar please refer to the Japid 1 manual.
