h1. japid42 - Japid for Play 2.1

Bing Ran (bing.ran@gmail.com)

version 0.9
Compatibility: Play 2.1.0

Note: version 0.7.4 and older is compatible with 2.0.4.

h2. About

Japid42 is a native Java based template engine for Java programmers using Play2. 

# Very fast in reloading changed views. You simply change the views and refresh your browser to get it right away in a blink instead of taking a coffee break. Japid manages its own view compilation and class loading. Changes in the Japid views are isolated from the Play reloading mechanism. 
# Full featured. It at least matches the feature set of the built-in Scala based template engine. 
# Excellent runtime performance. 
# Java-based, thus very friendly to Java programmers.
# The core Japid has been used in production for a long time and is very robust.  
# Japid views compile lazy and compile on demand, unnoticed.
# It integrates with Play2 well, in the meantime can be used alone with any Java applications.

h2. Features

- freely mixing Java code in templates.
- layout inheritance
- tags and local snippet
- controller action invocations from within views
- implicit objects available in views: request, response, session, flash, lang
- all sorts of directives
- support Play2 forms, fields, data binding and form validations. 
- cache with action invocation, wither using the Cached annotation or timeout spec in `a directive 
- session.authentityToken to protect app from forged form submission attach. 
- render data to dynamic templates in memory


h2. Usage



h4. For a full sample application with Japid, see: http://github.com/branaway/computer-japid

Please also check out the JapidSample project in the samples directory for an example. 

Basically you'll need to do three things:

0. Get the dependencies

- declare Japid in the project/Build.scala and add the local repository resolver:
<pre>
//...
    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "japid42" % "japid42_2.10" % "0.8.1"
    )

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies).settings(
      resolvers += Resolver.url("My GitHub Play Repository", url("http://branaway.github.com/releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    )
//...
</pre>

Note: adjust the version number accordingly. 

1. Initialize Japid in Global.java in the app directory:

<pre>
public class Global extends cn.bran.japid.template.JapidRenderer{}
</pre>  

Note:

- There are a few things that can be customized here. Please see the javadoc of JapidRenderer. 
   
Please see the @computer-japid@ example for a real-world Global class definition.

2. Extend cn.bran.play.JapidController to create your own controllers and use the renderJapid(...) etc to render the views. 

<pre>
package controllers;

import play.mvc.Result;
import cn.bran.play.JapidController;

public class Application extends JapidController {
  
  public static Result index() {
	  return renderJapid("cool");
  }
}
</pre>

3. Create the Japid view script "{my app root}/japidroot/japidviews/Application/index.html":

<pre>
@(String m)
Hello, $m!
</pre>

4. Hit http://localhost:9000/ to see Japid at work!

h2. Using Japid in Sub-projects

In Build.scala, you may have a sub-project defined like this:

<pre><code>
    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "japid42" % "japid42_2.10" % "0.8.1"
    )

    val foo = PlayProject("foo", "0.1", appDependencies, path = file("modules/foo"))

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies).settings(
      resolvers += Resolver.url("Japid on Github", url("http://branaway.github.com/releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    ).dependsOn(foo)
    
</code></pre>

Obviously you have a sub-project located in modules/foo. For the system to know the Japid scripts in the sub-project, you'll need to tell Japid the location, using the JapidRenderer.setTemplateRoot(String...) method, in the global initialization method:

<pre><code>
public class Global extends JapidRenderer {
	@Override
	public void onStartJapid() {
		setTemplateRoot("japidroot", "modules/foo/japidroot");
	}
}
</code></pre>

In the above example, the first argument is the location of the Japid scripts in the parent project. The second argument is the root for the Japid scripts in the sub-project. All paths are relative to the root of the master project. 

The @computer-japid@(http://github.com/branaway/computer-japid) sample application demos this feature. 

h2. Documentation

The "computer-japid" sample project contains a README file that explains most of the Japid usage. Please refer to it. 

For detailed Japid grammar please refer to the Japid 1 manual before I write something formal：

h2. Sample applications

* http://github.com/branaway/computer-japid
* There is also a sample application in the sample/JapidSample. Please update the dependency entry in the project/Build.scala file. 


h2. Hacking Japid42 in Eclipse

1. Git clone the Japid42 project to your local computer. 
2. Build it and publish it to your local repository: "play publish-local", where the play is the Play2 binary. 

Note:

- I'm using sbt 0.12.2 locally. Match the sbt version in the "project/build.properties" file to yours . 
- Also check and match the sbt-plugin version in the "project/plugins.sbt" file to your local version. 


h2. History

2012.3.24: v0.1
# initial commit. 

2012.3.27: v0.2
# lots of fix and the JapidSample mostly works now.  

2012.4.4: v0.2.1
# added JapidRenderer.setLogVerbose() to control logging verbosity of Japid activities.

2012.7.28: v0.2.2
# updated the README and fixed the initialization part. 

2012.7.28: v0.3
# bug fix: import of empty _tags or _layouts caused compiler error. Now imports those packages only if there are any templates in the folders.
# enhancement: updated build files to work with play-2.0.3 release.

2012.10.12. v0.4, beta
# made it play 2.0.4 compatible
# major bug fix: class reloading on the controller side or the model side caused type mismatched problem. 

2012.10.17. v0.5
# major feature: added nice error reporting.  
# bug fix: htmlentities.properties file moved to conf

2012.10.23. v0.5.1
# enhancement: hide the template for dev error reporting from users. The side effect is users cannot customize the error reporting at dev time. 
# removed: removed _javatags, _errors special directories in japidviews folder. 
# added: ported some util methods from Play 1's JavaExtensions to WebUtils. 
# enhancement: merged Yuvi Masory's JDT compiler dependency change

2012.10.23. v0.5.2
# bug fix: error reporting of argument mismatch in calling Japid views from controller. 
# enhancement: added toString() to JapidResult so it can be used directly in Japid views as the result of directly calling a controller method. For an example, one can include the result of an action call directly in a script like this:
	<code>the value is $MyController.action(...).</code>
	
2012.11.1. v0.5.3
# enhancement: since I started using the Github pages as the repository, the readme file started referencing the resolver to it instead of local.  

2012.11.8. v0.5.4
# new feature: added JapidRenderer.setTemplateRoot(String...) that takes one or more japid roots. With this support, Japid can be used in project/sub-project layout.

2012.11.10. v0.5.5
# bug fix: failed to create folders matching controllers in mkdir()
# critical bug fix: play start did not work. Class was not found. 
# simplification: _layout and _tags were deprecated. Put shared stuff in the japidviews dir or configure import manually.

2012.11.10. v0.6
# enhancement: in dev mode, added compile on demand with delay, so that Japid script refactory is more reliable. 

2012.11.10. v0.6.1
# bug fix: detected abstract directive and throw exception in apply() in java code
# bug fix: noplay code contained old t variable
# bug fix: inner classes rendered false change alarm leading to excessive recompiling in dev mode.  

2012.11.18. v0.7. See the JapidSample42 for examples for the new features. 
# new feature: cached action invocation supported. One must create a Global class that inherits from JapidRender instead of directly from GlobalSettings. The annotation of Cached was activated. With JapidSample42, see: http://localhost:9000/more.Portlets/index
# new feature: security token now supported. With JapidSample42, see: http://localhost:9000/application/dumpPost/a/bb/ccc 

2012.11.20. v0.7.1  
# enhancement: the @authenticity token@ mechanism was remodeled and simplified. Two steps to combat cross-site forged form attach:
	- Annotate the form class with @cn.bran.play.AuthenticForm@
	- embed $authenticityToken() in the proper position of an html form in your Japid templates. The method would generate a hidden field in the form. 
	
	
2012.11.26. v0.7.2  
# new feature: JapidRenderer.setKeepJavaFiles(boolean) enabled users to hide all the Java files during the process of Japid script compilation. Default is true to keep the compatibility with old version. When set to false, this configuration is faster in scanning changed files.  

2012.11.27. v0.7.3  
# removed: no logging in the template classloader any more. Solid enough to turn it off. 

2012.12.2. v0.7.4  
# added JapidRenderer.registerTemplate(...): it's intended for use at runtime to dynamically add new Japid script to the engine.
# enhancement: reduced file system access while refreshing Japid template classes.   

2013.2.8. v0.8 
# changed for Play 2.1.0 compatibility

2013.2.8. v0.8.1 
# new feature: using dynamic template in memory. Now one can render data to a template in the form of Java String in memory. The template can be retrieved from a database storage for example:
    // an action in a controller
	public static Result dynamic() {
		String template = "`(String s, int i)\nhi ${s}, are you ${i} years old?";
		return ok(renderDynamic(template, "Johnny", 13));
	}
2013.5.3. v0.9
# breaking change: refactored JapidRenderer to Play independent. Added GlobalSettingsWithJapid for users to extend from when creating the Global configurations:

  public class Global extends cn.bran.play.GlobalSettingsWithJapid {
        @Override
        public void onStartJapid() {
            setTemplateRoot("japidroot", "modules/foo/japidroot");
            setLogVerbose(true);
            setKeepJavaFiles(false); // keep the Java code derived from Japid scripts in memory only
            addImport("com.foo");
        }
  }
# New feature: now the JapidRenderer can be used out of Play to render any data to Japid scripts. e.g.:

	@Test
	public void testDynamic() throws IOException {
		JapidRenderer.setKeepJavaFiles(false);
		JapidRenderer.init(OpMode.dev, "japidroot", 1, null, JapidRenderer.class.getClassLoader());
		
		String template = "`(String s, int i)\n";
		template +="hi ${s}, are you ${i} years old?";
		template +="\n`t japidviews._tags.taggy `-"; // calling a tag on hard drive
		//
		RenderResult rr = JapidRenderer.renderDynamic(template, "Johnny", 13);
		System.out.println(rr);
		//
		rr = JapidRenderer.renderWith("japidviews/myscript.html", "hi", 123);
		System.out.println(rr);
		
	}
	
	Pay attention to the renderDynamic(...) and renderWith(...) methods.
