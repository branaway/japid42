h1. japid42 - Japid for Play 2

Bing Ran (bing.ran@gmail.com)

version 0.5.2
Status: beta



h2. About

This is a port of Japid to the Play2 framework.  

The idea is to have a native Java based template engine for Java programmers using Play2. 

Some of the benefits of using Japid in Play2:

1. No latency in reloading changed views. You simply change the views and refresh your browser to get it right away in literally a blink instead of a coffee break. Japid manages its own view compilation and class loading. Changes in the Japid views are isolated from the Play reloading mechanism. 

2. Full featured. It at least matches the feature set of the built-in Scala based template engine. 

3. Excellent runtime performance. 

4. Java-based, thus very friendly to Java programmers.

5. The core Japid has been used in production for a long time and is very robust.  


h2. Features

Most of the Japid 1 features have been ported:

- layout
- tags
- action invocations from views
- implicit objects available in views: request, response, session, flash
- other language constructs

What are missing?

- cache with action invocation, i.e., the @`a@ command does not support cache yet.
- validation: I'm still investigating how the whole validation thing works in Play2. 
- Flash success/error: the new flash in Play2 is a generic HashMap. 
- session.authentityToken not supported
- implicit objects: "params" and "args"

What are different?

- reverse routing: @{} not supported and deprecated by Play2's direct route class call for each route rule. 

h2. Build the module from source

1. Git clone the Japid42 project to your local computer. 
2. Build it and publish it to your local repository: "play publish-local", where the play is the Play2 binary. 

Note:

- I'm using sbt 0.11.3 locally. Match the sbt version in the "project/build.properties" file to yours . 
- Also check and match the sbt-plugin version in the "project/plugins.sbt" file to your local version. 

h2. Hack Japid42 in Eclipse

1. In the root directory of japid42: play eclipse 
2. import the project in Eclipse. 
3. Fix the missing classes_managed folder as reported. 


h2. Usage

h4. For a full application with Japid, see: http://github.com/branaway/computer-japid


Please check out the JapidSample project in the samples directory for an example. 

Basically you'll need to do three things:

0. Get the dependencies

- declare Japid in the project/Build.scala and add the local repository resolver:
<pre>
//...
    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "japid42" % "japid42_2.9.1" % "0.5.2"
    )

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = JAVA).settings(
      resolvers += "Local Play Repository" at "/my/path/to/Play20/repository/local"
    )
//...
</pre>

Note: adjust the version number accordingly. 

1. Initialize Japid in Global.java in the app directory:

<pre>

import play.Application;
import play.GlobalSettings;
import cn.bran.japid.template.JapidRenderer;

public class Global extends GlobalSettings {
	@Override
	public void onStart(Application app) {
		JapidRenderer.init(app);
// there are more customization you can do to Japid
//		JapidRenderer.addImportStatic(StringUtils.class);
//		JapidRenderer.setLogVerbose(true);
	}

}
</pre>  

Note:


- There are q few things that can be customized. Please see the javadoc of JapidRenderer. 
   
   
2. Extend cn.bran.play.JapidController to create your own controllers and use the renderJapid(...) etc to render the views. 

<pre>
package controllers;

import play.mvc.Result;
import cn.bran.play.JapidController;

public class Application extends JapidController {
  
  public static Result index() {
	  return renderJapid("cool");
  }
}
</pre>

3. Create the Japid view script "japidroot/japidviews/Application/index.html":

<pre>
@(String m)
alright: $m!
</pre>

4. Hit http://localhost:9000/ to see Japid at work!



For detailed Japid grammar please refer to the Japid 1 manual before I write something formal：

h2. A sample application

There is a sample application in the sample/JapidSample. Please update the dependency entry in the project/Build.scala file. 

h2. History

2012.3.24: v0.1
# initial commit. 

2012.3.27: v0.2
# lots of fix and the JapidSample mostly works now.  

2012.4.4: v0.2.1
# added JapidRenderer.setLogVerbose() to control logging verbosity of Japid activities.

2012.7.28: v0.2.2
# updated the README and fixed the initialization part. 

2012.7.28: v0.3
# bug fix: import of empty _tags or _layouts caused compiler error. Now imports those packages only if there are any templates in the folders.
# enhancement: updated build files to work with play-2.0.3 release.

2012.10.12. v0.4, beta
# made it play 2.0.4 compatible
# major bug fix: class reloading on the controller side or the model side caused type mismatched problem. 

2012.10.17. v0.5
# major feature: added nice error reporting.  
# bug fix: htmlentities.properties file moved to conf

2012.10.23. v0.5.1
# enhancement: hide the template for dev error reporting from users. The side effect is users cannot customize the error reporting at dev time. 
# removed: removed _javatags, _errors special directories in japidviews folder. 
# added: ported some util methods from Play 1's JavaExtensions to WebUtils. 
# enhancement: merged Yuvi Masory's JDT compiler dependency change

2012.10.23. v0.5.2
# bug fix: error reporting of argument mismatch in calling Japid views from controller. 
# enhancement: added toString() to JapidResult so it can be used directly in Japid views as the result of directly calling a controller method. For an example, one can include the result of an action call direcly in a script like this:
	<code>the value is $MyController.action(...).</code>
